## The Validation Set Approach

The basic idea behind the validation set approach is to split the available data into a training set and a testing set. A regression model is developed using only the training set. Consider Figure \@ref(fig:vsa) which illustrates a split of the available data into a training set and a testing set. 

```{r, label = "vsa", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Validation set approach"}
knitr::include_graphics("./PNG/valdset.png", dpi = 96)
```

The percent of values that are allocated into training and testing may vary based on the size of the available data. It is not unusual to allocate 70–75% of the available data as the training set and the remaining 25–30% as the testing set. The predictive performance of a regression model is assessed using the testing set. One of the more common methods to assess the predictive performance of a regression model is the mean square prediction error (MSPE). The MSPE is defined as

\begin{equation}
\textrm{MSPE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
(\#eq:mspe)
\end{equation}

## Leave-One-Out Cross Validation

The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) eliminates the problem of variability in MSPE present in the validation set approach. The LOOCV is similar to the validation set approach as the available $n$ observations are split into training and testing sets. The difference is that each of the available $n$ observations are split into $n$ training and $n$ testing sets where each of the $n$ training sets consist of $n - 1$ observations and each of the testing sets consists of a single different value from the original $n$ observations. Figure \@ref(fig:LOOC) provides a schematic display of the leave-one-out cross-validation process with testing sets (light shade) and training sets (dark shade) for a data set of $n$ observations. 

```{r, label = "LOOC", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Leave-one-out cross validation"}
knitr::include_graphics("./PNG/loocv.png", dpi = 96)
```

The MSPE is computed with each testing set resulting in $n$ values of MSPE. The LOOCV estimate for the test MSPE is the average of these $n$ MSPE values denoted as

\begin{equation}
\textrm{CV}_{(n)} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\textrm{MSPE}_i
(\#eq:loocv)
\end{equation}

## $k$-Fold Cross Validation

$k$-fold cross-validation is similar to LOOCV in that the available data is split into training sets and testing sets; however, instead of creating $n$ different training and testing sets, $k$ folds/groups of training and testing sets are created where $k < n$ and each fold consists of roughly $n/k$ values in the testing set and $1 - n/k$ values in the training set. Figure \@ref(fig:KFCV) shows a schematic display of 5-fold cross-validation. The lightly shaded rectangles are the testing sets and the darker shaded rectangles are the training sets. 

```{r, label = "KFCV", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Five fold cross-validation"}
knitr::include_graphics("./PNG/cv.png", dpi = 96)
```


The MSPE is computed on each of the $k$ folds using the testing set to evaluate the regression model built from the training set. The weighted average of $k$ MSPE values is denoted as

\begin{equation}
\textrm{CV}_{(k)} = \sum_{k=1}^{k}\frac{n_k}{n}\textrm{MSPE}_k
(\#eq:kfcv)
\end{equation}

Note that LOOCV is a special case of $k$-fold cross-validation where $k$ is set equal to $n$. An important advantage $k$-fold cross-validation has over LOOCV is that $\textrm{CV}_{k}$ for $k = 5$ or $k = 10$ provides a more accurate estimate of the test error rate than does $\textrm{CV}_n$.

## Creating some data


```{r label = "somedata"}
set.seed(357)
n <- 1000           # Number of observations to generate
SD <- 0.5
xs <- sort(runif(n, 5, 9))
ys <- sin(xs) + rnorm(n, 0, SD)
DF <- data.frame(x = xs, y = ys)
rm(xs, ys)
library(DT)
datatable(DF)
```

## Validation Set Approach

* Create a training set using 75% of the observations in `DF`.
* Sort the observations in the training and testing sets.

```{r}
n <- nrow(DF)
train <- sample(n, floor(0.75 * n), replace = FALSE)
trainSET <- DF[train, ]
trainSET <- trainSET[order(trainSET$x), ]
testSET <- DF[-train, ]
testSET <- testSET[order(testSET$x), ]
dim(trainSET)
dim(testSET)
```

* Fit a quadratic model using the training set (`trainSET`).

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Base R
plot(y ~ x, data = trainSET, pch = 19, cex = .25, col = "blue")
modq <- lm(y ~ poly(x, 2, raw = TRUE), data = trainSET)
yhat <- predict(modq, data = trainSET)
lines(trainSET$x, yhat, col = "red")
# ggplot2 approach
ggplot(data = trainSET, aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 1) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2, raw = TRUE), color = "red", se = FALSE)
# Summary of quadratic model
summary(modq)
```

## Compute the training `MSPE`

```{r}
MSPE <- mean(resid(modq)^2)
MSPE
```

## Compute the testing `MSPE`

```{r}
yhtest <- predict(modq, newdata = testSET)
MSPEtest <- mean((testSET$y - yhtest)^2)
MSPEtest
```

## Fit a cubic model.

```{r}
# Base R
plot(y ~ x, data = trainSET, pch = 19, cex = .25, col = "blue")
modc <- lm(y ~ poly(x, 3, raw = TRUE), data = trainSET)
yhat <- predict(modc, data = trainSET)
lines(trainSET$x, yhat, col = "red")
# ggplot2 approach
ggplot(data = trainSET, aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 0.5) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 3, raw = TRUE), color = "red", se = FALSE)
# Summary of cubic model
summary(modc)
```

## Compute the training `MSPE`

```{r}
MSPE <- mean(resid(modc)^2)
MSPE
```

## Compute the testing `MSPE`

```{r}
yhtest <- predict(modc, newdata = testSET)
MSPEtest <- mean((testSET$y - yhtest)^2)
MSPEtest
```

## Your Turn

* Create a training set (80%) and testing set (20%) of the observations from the data frame `HSWRESTLER` from the `PASWR2` package. Store the results from regressing `hwfat` onto `abs` and `triceps` in the object `modf`.

* Compute the test `MSPE`.

* Note how the answers of your classmates are all different.  The validation estimate of the test MSPE can be highly variable.

## Your Turn

The left side of Figure 5.2 on page 178 of @james_introduction_2013 shows the validation approach used on the `Auto` data set in order to estimate the test error that results from predicting `mpg` using polynomial functions of `horsepower` for one particular split of the original data.  The code below creates a similar graph.

```{r}
library(ISLR)
n <- nrow(Auto)
plot(1:10, type ="n", xlab = "Degree of Polynomial", ylim = c(15, 30), 
     ylab = "Mean Squared Prediction Error") 
IND <- sample(1:n, size = floor(n/2), replace = FALSE)
train <- Auto[IND, ]
test <- Auto[-IND, ]
for(i in 1:10){
    mod <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, i), data = train)
    pred <- predict(mod, newdata = test)
    MSPE[i] <- mean((test$mpg - pred)^2)
  }
lines(1:10, MSPE, col = "red")
points(1:10, MSPE, col = "red", pch = 19)
# ggplot2 approach
DF2 <- data.frame(x = 1:10, MSPE = MSPE)
ggplot(data = DF2, aes(x = x, y = MSPE)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 2) + 
  geom_line(color = "red") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  ylim(15, 30) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:10) + 
  labs(x = "Degree of Polynomial", y = "Mean Squared Prediction Error")
```


* Modify the code above to recreate a graph similar to the right side of Figure 5.2 on page 178 of @james_introduction_2013.  Hint: Place a `for` loop before `IND`.

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
# Your Code Here
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
```



## $k$ Fold Cross Validation

* Create $k = 5$ folds.
* Compute the $\textrm{CV}_{k=5}$ for `modq`.  

```{r}
set.seed(1)
k <- 5
MSPE <- numeric(k)
folds <- sample(x = 1:k, size = nrow(DF), replace = TRUE)
xtabs(~folds)
sum(xtabs(~folds))
for(j in 1:k){
  modq <- lm(y ~ poly(x, 2, raw = TRUE), data = DF[folds != j, ])
  pred <- predict(modq, newdata = DF[folds ==j, ])
  MSPE[j] <- mean((DF[folds == j, ]$y - pred)^2) 
}
MSPE
weighted.mean(MSPE, table(folds)/sum(folds))
```

## Your Turn

* Compute the $\textrm{CV}_8$ for `modf`. Recall that `modf` was created from regressing `hwfat` onto `abs` and `triceps`. 


```{r}
# Your Code Here
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
```


## Using `cv.glm` from `boot`

```{r}
set.seed(1)
library(boot)
glm.fit <- glm(y ~ poly(x, 2, raw = TRUE), data = DF)
cv.err <- cv.glm(data = DF, glmfit = glm.fit, K = 5)$delta[1]
cv.err
```


## Your Turn

* Compute $\textrm{CV}_8$ for `modf` using `cv.glm`.  Recall that `modf` was created from regressing `hwfat` onto `abs` and `triceps`. 

```{r}
# Your Code Here

```



## Your Turn

The right side of Figure 5.4 on page 180 of @james_introduction_2013 shows the 10-fold cross-validation approach used on the `Auto` data set in order to estimate the test error that results from predicting `mpg` using polynomial functions of `horsepower` run nine separate times.  The code below creates a graph showing one particular run.

```{r}
plot(1:10, type ="n", xlab = "Degree of Polynomial", ylim = c(16, 26), 
     ylab = "Mean Squared Prediction Error", main = "10-fold CV") 
k <- 10 # number of folds
MSPE <- numeric(k)
cv <- numeric(k)
  for(i in 1:10){
    folds <- sample(x = 1:k, size = nrow(Auto), replace = TRUE)
    for(j in 1:k){
      mod <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, i, raw = TRUE), data = Auto[folds != j, ])
      pred <- predict(mod, newdata = Auto[folds ==j, ])
      MSPE[j] <- mean((Auto[folds == j, ]$mpg - pred)^2) 
    }
    cv[i] <- weighted.mean(MSPE, table(folds)/sum(folds))
  }
  lines(1:10, cv, col = "red")
  points(1:10, cv, col = "red", pch = 19)
```


* Use a `for` loop to run the above code nine times.  The result should look similar to the right side of Figure 5.4 on page 180 of @james_introduction_2013. 

```{r}
# Your Code Here
#
#
#

## Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation


```{r}
set.seed(1)
k <- nrow(DF)
MSPE <- numeric(k)
folds <- sample(x = 1:k, size = nrow(DF), replace = FALSE)  
# Note that replace changes to FALSE for LOOCV...can you explain why?
for(j in 1:k){
  modq <- lm(y ~ poly(x, 2, raw = TRUE), data = DF[folds != j, ])
  pred <- predict(modq, newdata = DF[folds ==j, ])
  MSPE[j] <- mean((DF[folds == j, ]$y - pred)^2) 
}
mean(MSPE)
```

## Your Turn

* Compute $\textrm{CV}_n$ for `modf`.  Recall that `modf` was created from regressing `hwfat` onto `abs` and `triceps`. 

```{r}
# Your Code Here

#
#
#
#
#

```


Recall 

$$CV_{n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{y_i - \hat{y_i}}{1 - h_i}\right)^2$$

```{r}
modq <- lm(y ~ poly(x, 2, raw = TRUE), data = DF)
h <- hatvalues(modq)
CVn <- mean(((DF$y - predict(modq))/(1 - h))^2)
CVn
```

## Your Turn

```


## Using `cv.glm` from `boot`

* Note: If one does not use the `K` argument for the number of folds, `gv.glm` will compute LOOCV.

```{r}

glm.fit <- glm(y ~ poly(x, 2, raw = TRUE), data = DF)
cv.err <- cv.glm(data = DF, glmfit = glm.fit)$delta[1]
